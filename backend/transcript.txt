I just got an email saying family camp was cancelled. Not enough sign-ups. That's it? You don't care at all, do you? You're too busy running around with that girl from last night. Yeah, that's right. I know everything. How could you, Luke? To be honest, I don't know why I was so upset. I knew I was supposed to be mad, but I couldn't figure out why, so I just started saying a bunch of stuff. Under my roof? That was weird. In a bed that I paid for? What does that have to do with anything? With your grandfather watching! What? But it wasn't half as crazy as what I really wanted to yell, which was, Just stop growing up.
